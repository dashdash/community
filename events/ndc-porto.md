### Good talks we've seen

#### [Build vs Buy: Software Systems at Jurassic Park](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2tivS4uCfs&list=PL03Lrmd9CiGeSu3F7Te9euJXvqz3wnmvJ&index=29) by Todd Gardner

Very fun talk that uncovers the options, costs, and risks inherent in deciding what software to build and what to buy.

Questions to ask when making a decision:

- What is the impact of failure?
- Could we sell it?
- What is our bias?
- What could we do instead?
- Is it sustainable?

Memorable quote:
> If you can't sell it, buy it.

#### [Six Little Lines of Fail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvUdvte1V3s&list=PL03Lrmd9CiGeSu3F7Te9euJXvqz3wnmvJ&index=21) by Jimmy Bogard

Teaches you to think about how your code that interacts with external services can fail.
Gives several options to deal with failure: ignore, retry, undo, and coordinate.
The examples used are very relevant to our current challanges with billing.
