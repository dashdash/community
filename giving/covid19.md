# Why HELP

* The COVID-19 pandemic affects everyone, but mostly those who are less fortunate. 
* The Portuguese institution CASA (NIF: 506116786) needs our help.
* And so a group of entrepreneus and friends are organizing a drive to collect up to **34.000€**, enough to sustain hundreds of families for about 2 months. 
* This is a lean, volunteer-based operation, and your money will go directly into food supplies + kit material that will support the majority of 4.059 people (1542 families).

# Background

The institution [CASA](https://casa-apoioaosemabrigo.org) (_Centro de Apoio ao Sem-Abrigo_ or the Center for Support to the Homeless) has been very affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

In terms of personnel, CASA was affected by:
- a loss of available volunteers for teams.
- the need to better prepare available teams, considering they are helping a population that is particularly vulnerable to the spread of COVID-19.

In material terms, the impact is also mostly 2 factors:
- for security reasons, food delivery is now done exclusively via wrapped kits, including utensils. They are being purchased by the local delegations with available emergency funds. Prior to COVID-19, CASA delivered food directly to the homeless and also organized "social restaurants" where people could have a sat-down hot dinner served by volunteers, 365 days of the year.
- the drives for collecting donated funds are the main way they replenish stocks. However, because of the virus, supermarket drives are closed. The warehouses are in a critical state. As an example, in March the distribution of food baskets to ~90 families had to stop due to insufficient food.

The team at CASA quantified that 34k€ is enough to sustain the food stock for 2 more months. Of this money, 28k€ is food and 6k€ is material for the kits (at ~0.2€/ meal). All the work is done by volunteers. 

These food kits will be delivered by CASA. This effort will support a majority of 1542 families, that represent 4.059 beneficiaries. 

# Detail 

The food will support the local CASA operations in ALBUFEIRA, CASCAIS, COIMBRA, FARO, FIGUEIRA FOZ, LISBOA, MADEIRA, PORTO, PAREDES, SETÚBAL.

And will purchase >97.000 units of the following goods: sugar, rice, pasta (Spaghetti and other formats), flour, beans (dry and canned), chickpeas (dry and canned), salt, tuna, tomatoes (canned), sausages (pre-cooked), olive oil, cooking oil, milk. It's mostly 1kg/ 1L sized food-items. CASA has a detailed list of needs per zone in case you want to check it (contact me).
